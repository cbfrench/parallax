# parallax
Simple parallax image effect for website images

### Usage
Include this file in your site's `<head>` tag. Any element that will contain a parallax image must have the class `parallax` added to it. The data attribute `parallax-image` must be the `src` of the image that you are trying to give the effect to. The `parallax-speed` attribute is used to determine the speed of the effect, 0 being motionless and 9 being almost completely fluid with the page. It defaults to 5 if no value is given. The image that is generated will have the `parallax-image` class attached to it if you require any additional styling. Works on mobile and resizing window.
